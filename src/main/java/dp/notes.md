Dynamic Programming (DP) is a programming paradigm that can systematically and efficiently explore all possible solutions to a problem. As such, it is capable of solving a wide variety of problems that often have the following characteristics:

The problem can be broken down into "overlapping subproblems" - smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times.
The problem has an "optimal substructure" - an optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions to the overlapping subproblems of the original problem.

3 states of DP:
1. Container (dp array)
2. State transition (recurrence relation)
3. Base case


for any Dp problem consider the following:
1. Overlapping subproblems (smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times)
2. Optimal substructure
3. Reconstructing the solution
