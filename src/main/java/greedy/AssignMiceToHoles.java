/**
 * Problem Description
 * N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accommodate only one mouse.
 *
 * The positions of Mice are denoted by array A, and the position of holes is denoted by array B.
 *
 * A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consume 1 minute.
 *
 * Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.
 *
 *
 *
 * Problem Constraints
 * 1 <= N <= 105
 *
 * -109 <= A[i], B[i] <= 109
 *
 *
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first argument is an integer array A.
 *
 * The second argument is an integer array B.
 *
 *
 *
 * Output Format
 * Return an integer denoting the minimum time when the last nouse gets inside the holes.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example Input
 * Input 1:
 *
 *  A = [-4, 2, 3]
 *  B = [0, -2, 4]
 * Input 2:
 *
 *  A = [-2]
 *  B = [-6]
 *
 *
 * Example Output
 * Output 1:
 *
 *  2
 * Output 2:
 *
 *  4
 *
 *
 * Example Explanation
 * Explanation 1:
 *
 *  Assign the mouse at position (-4 to -2), (2 to 0) and (3 to 4).
 *  The number of moves required will be 2, 2 and 1 respectively.
 *  So, the time taken will be 2.
